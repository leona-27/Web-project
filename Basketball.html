            <h1>What is Basketball? </h1>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players each, primarily indoors on a rectangular court. The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted 10 feet above the ground on each end of the court. Players advance the ball by dribbling or passing it while following specific rules, such as dribbling violations, traveling, and fouls.

The game involves a combination of athleticism, skill, strategy, and teamwork. Players score by shooting the ball into the opponent's hoop, earning different points depending on the distance from where the shot was taken. The team with the most points at the end of the game, typically divided into quarters, wins.

Basketball is known for its fast-paced nature, requiring players to possess various skills like shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, and defending. It's a popular sport globally, with professional leagues such as the NBA (National Basketball Association) in the United States being widely followed, along with international competitions like the Olympics and FIBA World Cup showcasing top-level talent from around the world.</p>
