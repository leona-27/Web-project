            <h2>What is football? </h2>
            <p>Football, known as soccer in some regions, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. It is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The primary objective of football is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opponent's goal while following specific rules and regulations.

Players use their feet (and sometimes other parts of the body except the hands or arms, except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area) to maneuver the ball and pass it to teammates, aiming to advance towards the opponent's goal. The team that scores the most goals within the allocated time wins the match.

Football is characterized by its continuous gameplay, requiring players to possess various skills such as dribbling, passing, tackling, shooting, and strategic positioning. It's one of the most popular and widely followed sports globally, with numerous professional leagues and competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, English Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and many others, attracting millions of fans worldwide.</p>
